- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Maers. A Full Stack developer, results oriented and with excellent communication skills. I was born in Argentina and since I was a child, I wanted to make videogames. I studied one year at the university but I had to leave it to start working. After ten years regretting that, I decided to start over but in a different branch.
That's how I started my studies at Soy Henry, a extensive school that have teached me everything I can do right now, but I still want to learn more. 

If you are interested in working with me, you will find in me a proactive person, eager to work and expand their knowledge more and more! The technologies that I currently use are: Javascript, CSS3, SASS, LESS HTML5, Node.JS, React, React-Routing, React-Redux, ES5, ES6, AJAX, React Hooks, webpack, Web Server, Express, SQL databases, postgreSQL , Sequelize, Promises, Async Await, agile methodologies (SCRUM), mocha.
