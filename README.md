My name is Daniel. I was born in Argentina and since I was a child I was interested in the IT world. I love to code and continue learning technologies.
I'm looking to relocate outside of Latin America due to the economic situation and the insecurity that my country is going through.
If you are interested in working with me, you will find in me a proactive person, eager to work and expand their knowledge more and more!
The technologies I currently handle are: Javascript, CSS3, LESS, HTML5, Node.JS, React, React-Router Dom, Redux, ES5, ES6, AJAX, React Hooks, webpack, Web Server, Express, SQL databases, postgreSQL, Sequelize, Promises, Async Await, agile methodologies (SCRUM), unit testing (JEST).
